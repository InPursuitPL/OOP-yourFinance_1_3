Hi, this is my Text User Interface program called yourFinance. 
It is created as a project to get to know and learn Object Oriented Programming in practice.
I am aware that some elements (like functionality itself) are a bit goofy but please remember
that this is just a simple program to learn OOP and this is the only reason why I created it.
My main goals, while working on it, were to design it as good as I can at this moment 
(in terms of Object Oriented Design, not functionality) and to make it possibly user-error-proof.
I created some (not advanced) unit tests and I would like to extend this topic in the future.
All sugestions, advices and constructive criticism will be MUCH appreciated!

Start it with main.py, program stores data as shelve files and uses nose for automated tests.
